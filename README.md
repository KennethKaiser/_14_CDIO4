Hello! And welcome to our 3-wwek exam project!

ARE YOU A WINDOWS USER?!?? READ FURTHER!

This whole project has been exciting to say the least, and have been challenging in alot of aspects, from adding animations, to build a GUI from scratch.

What you see here is our project 1.0. There are minor bugs, that we plan to fix sometime soon when we get the time for it. Nothing game-breaking, just stuff that bug our minds, mainly visual ;-)

To run the project on a Windows Computer: Download and build project. If you are on a computer with 1920x1080 pixels, and you are using screen-zoom higher than 100%.
Set the screen zoom to 100%. We will look into getting DPI-scaling to work 100% in the future, but DPI-scaling is wonkly at best to say the least.

This will be released under personal use copyright when project is done, but until then, all rights rerserved!

Have a lovely day, and thanks for watching.

Kind regards
Team 14, Mikkel, Kenneth, Andreas, Nicklas and Tobias
DTU Lyngby.
